I study demography and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.  

I grew up in [Shenzhen](https://www.archdaily.com/932731/the-curious-history-and-beauty-of-shenzhens-urban-villages), a bustling megacity of migrants and opportunities in South China, where I completed my undergraduate degree in *Journalism*. It wasn't until many years after I left the city that I realized it was, at least back then, the most diverse city in China.  

My interest in social inequality and the experience as an exchange student in Chinese Culture University at Taipei motivated me to pursue a graduate study in sociology, abroad. I accidentally ended up in a master program (DASA) in demography at UC Irvine, and it opened a brand-new door for me. I learned a lot and got interested in topics such as one-child policy, aging, and second demographic transition (i.e. changing family behaviors). I spent the happiest time in Irvine and continue to visit back.  

After the DASA program, I went to the MAPSS program at UChicago, and later, a doctoral program at UPenn.  

I am interested in how inequality is produced, maintained, and strengthened during fast or slow social changes such as demographic transition, education expansion, and climate change.  

Some specific research questions that I am working, including......

My favorite food is [Chaoshan rice-roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJsyC1Kpew), it is a totally different thing compared to Guangzhou rice-roll that is commonly served in almost every Dim Dum places in US Chinatown.  

I have been a big fan of rock and indie music, from both local and British bands, since a very young age. Over the past several years, I've been addicted to the band [My Little Airport (A dive into young people’s discontent through the Hong Kong indie band)](https://hongkongfp.com/2021/11/19/a-dive-into-young-peoples-discontent-through-the-hong-kong-indie-band-my-little-airport/) from Hong Kong, and the band [Wu Tiao Ren (What China’s Hottest Rock Band Can Tell Us About the Nation’s Cultural Shifts)](https://fairbank.fas.harvard.edu/events/what-chinas-coolest-rock-band-can-tell-us-about-the-nations-cultural-shifts/) from Haifeng. Both bands sing about the subtle joys and sorrows of everyday life in a plain yet poetic way, resonating with the experiences of ordinary people in a modern but an uncertain society. Their songs are more sociological than many sociological theories that I wrote and studied. 

I spend a lot of time indoors, working, thinking, and procrastinating, but deep down in my heart, I know I love the outdoors and nature.
