I am a Postdoc Research Scientist in Population Health at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. I completed my Ph.D. in Demography and Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, where I also earned a masterâ€™s degree in Statistics and Data Science. I am broadly interested in social demography, population aging, and social inequalities. My research adopts a quantitative approach with an emphasis on comparative perspectives. At the macro level, my research examines the demographic transition and its implications, with particular attention to population aging and family change. At the micro level, I study the transition to retirement and inequalities in later life. I am especially interested in how retirement policies shape and reinforce disparities across gender, social class, and national contexts. I have also conducted research on the impacts of environmental factors on demographic and health-related outcomes. My research has been recognized with paper awards from the ASA sections on Aging and the Life Course, Sociology of Population, and Sociology of Development, among others. I also have teaching experience at both the undergraduate and graduate levels and received the Excellence in Teaching Award from the University of Pennsylvania.
